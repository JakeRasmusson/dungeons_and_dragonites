## Description

Our esteemed group embarked on a noble quest: to craft a gaming masterpiece leveraging the prowess of two distinct API calls. With unwavering determination, we chose to harness the mystical energies of the DND5EAPI and the enchanting allure of the Pokeapi. As the curtains rise on our digital stage, players are bestowed with a divine gift: a whimsical Pokémon from the hallowed annals of the original 151 creatures. Armed with this mystical companion, adventurers delve into the perilous depths of the Dungeons and Dragons universe, confronting a myriad of foes lurking in the shadows. With each passing encounter, the crucible of battle grows ever fiercer, challenging the very essence of our players' intellect and dexterity. In this epic odyssey, players are tasked with enduring the relentless onslaught of increasingly formidable adversaries, testing the limits of their strategic acumen and tactical finesse. Will you emerge victorious, defying the odds in this captivating turn-based journey through the labyrinthine depths of our dungeon crawler?

## Installation


Select index.html to open the webpage.  You have two options.  The door on the left takes you to the battle page, and the door on the right takes you to the high scores treasure hoard.  If you want to battle select the Enter the Dungeon door.  A random pokemon and monster will be generated for you.  To play the game you will simply click "Attack!", the game will roll the dice for you and attack the enemy.  A modal will popup with your attack summary.  Once you close the modal the enemy will take their turn.  If you defeat the enemy another modal will open with three options: Increase Attack, Increase Max HP and Restore Health.  Select one and the website will generate another monster for you to battle.  Continue this loop until you lose.  Another modal will pop up prompting you to input your name.  If your score is in the top ten it will be added to local storage and be displayed in the high score treasure hoard.  Select play again to be given another Pokémon and another shot at glory. If you want to see the scores select the check High Scores door.
